      <p class="blog-text">These are the same steps I took to becoming a developer. I have no college degree, no bootcamp certificate, and precious little formal training of any kind. Yet today, I'm an experienced programmer in Python and C++, a lead developer, an internship supervisor, a debugging expert, and an author of programming articles and (now) books. I am by no means unusual. A surprising number of developers have taken "non-traditional" pathways into this industry. <br><br>
Whether you're in college for computer science, attending a bootcamp, or just teaching yourself in your basement, these tips are for you. This is the definitive guide to becoming a software developer, no matter what path you're on!.</p>

          <h4><li>Learn A Language</li></h4>
         
          <p class="blog-text">This is perhaps the most painfully obvious item on the list. Programmers write computer code, so you have to learn to speak the language. However, it doesn't matter what programming language you learn first! It all depends on what you're interested in. For example If you want to get into web development, you should start with JavaScript or CSS (yes, nerds, CSS is Turing-complete!)


 If you want to build user applications, Python, C#, and Java are popular entry points.

If you're interested in systems development (such as operating systems), look into Rust or C++.

If you want to play with data analysis or statistics, start with Python or R.</p>
          
          <h4><li>Write Code</li></h4>
          <p class="blog-text">Theory is all well and good, but it means absolutely nothing until you put it into practice.

I often compare programming to swimming: you can read about swimming all you want, but it won't mean a thing until you jump in the water. Furthermore, if you only stay in the shallow end, you'll never become proficient. You NEED to dive into the deep end as soon as possible. Create a project for yourself.
Make it something simple, something you'd personally use. No one can come up with this project for you. It should solve a problem you're acquainted with. YOU must be the target user! That ensures you have both the knowledge about the problem to build it, and the passion and drive to stick with it.</p>
          
          <h4><li>Read Code</li></h4>
          <p class="blog-text">Anyone who is studying English would read great books in English. In the same way, anyone who is studying programming should study great source code.

Unfortunately, this is often overlooked because it's just so intimidating. How do you find good code? What if you encounter things you don't understand? What file in a project should you even start with?

In terms of finding a project, GitHub Discover is a great place to start. Skim through the popular repositories. Find one written in a language you know or are studying. It's ideal if you find a project that you use, or which is about a topic you find interesting, but that's not essential.

Once you locate a project, browse through the file structure to get an idea about how the repository is laid out. This is more important than you might think! Don't worry about finding the "beginning" of the program. Just look for any file the right file extension indicating that it's code in the language you're interested in.</p>
